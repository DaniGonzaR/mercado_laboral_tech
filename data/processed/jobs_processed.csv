<p><br><strong>About our Growth team:</strong></p>
<p>The Growth collective at Monzo helps customers discover the unique value of Monzo and build healthy financial habits from day one. We focus on driving growth opportunities within our collective but also enable other internal teams to unlock additional value and build experiences our customers want to share with their family and friends.</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style=""""><strong>We are champions for our customers</strong>. We always aim to offer delightful experiences to the customer, giving them something they want rather than something we want.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>We translate growth hypotheses to bold experimentation.</strong> We use the results to validate the direction and understand the path we take.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>We focus on outcomes, not output.</strong> We are open to saying “no” to smaller incremental wins, if they distract us from achieving bigger things</li>
<li style=""""><strong>We approach growth as a team sport. </strong>We achieve greater things through collaboration, leveraging our differences, expertise, and perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>What you'll be working on.. </strong></p>
<p>Although Growth Design is a new specialism at Monzo, you’ll be surrounded by an experienced, passionate, and supportive team of product designers, user researchers, and writers - who all strive to ensure our customers, and teammates succeed. We’re a small but mighty team where every designer plays a critical role in improving our community of practice—whether that’s through improving our craft skills to leading rituals to giving great feedback.</p>
<p>Like all designers, you’ll be embedded in a cross-functional product squad, and will be responsible for all design contributions in the team; from initial discovery and user journey mapping through to the implementation of final UI design details (and all the stuff in between). As you ramp up, you’ll grow to deeply understand the customers you’re designing for - whether it’s joining user research sessions, learning from previous insights, or running your own lightweight research and analysis, you’ll strive to understand the what, why and how of the problems you’re solving for. You’ll take a pragmatic approach to balance the ideal experience with knowing where and when to make scoping trade-offs based on technical constraints, experimentation strategy or business risk - advocating for appropriate, intuitive and accessible user experiences. </p>
<p>Designers partner closely with Product Managers, Engineers, and Data scientists at Monzo to ensure teams aren't just shipping great designs, but they are deeply involved throughout the design process. You won’t be alone - our design and product leadership team is deeply connected to the work each squad and collective is engaged with - helping to make sure long-term strategy, business goals, and experience quality are all in alignment and that there are healthy opportunities for visibility and feedback.</p>
<p><br><strong>You should apply if..</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">A designer who confidently balances quality with humility. Stay open minded about alternative directions.</li>
<li style="""">An adept communicator, whether it’s articulating your work, engaging with others, or writing UX copy.</li>
<li style="""">Data-centric: whether that’s working with data partners or comfortable wrangling the data yourself.</li>
<li style="""">Experimentation minded: you are adept at creating hypotheses, creating test approaches and interpreting behaviour.</li>
<li style="""">Comfortable working in ambiguity, at pace.</li>
<li style="""">Motivated by cross functional ownership of the touchpoints you work on. You’re used to bringing people together and collaborating deeply on customer problems that span business areas.</li>
<li style="""">Focused on delivering outcomes and solutions to the problems, as an individual contributor, and a cross functional partner.</li>
<li style="""">A passion for leveraging new technology like Ai into their design workflow</li>
<li style="""">Can create delightful and engaging modern prototypes to a high degree of precision and quality</li>
<li style="""">A strong foundation in product design that cuts through generic layouts and injects personality and creativity</li>
<li style="""">Motivated by failure as a learning experience, not a blocker in moving forward</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Bonus points if:</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">You have facilitated design sprints.</li>
<li style="""">You’re comfortable creating scrappy prototypes and testing them with people in ways which give you confidence in the idea quickly.</li>
<li style="""">You’ve worked with the notion of ‘strong opinions loosely held’, having opinionated views based on data and experience, capable of pivoting quickly as you learn new things.</li>
<li style="""">You have built products at scale that cover multiple geographies. </li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>Our interview process involves 3 main stages: </strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Initial call (30 minutes). A video chat with Natalie who is part of our hiring team.  This focuses on general suitability and fit for Monzo.</li>
<li style="""">Craft/Case study interview (1 hour). We will ask you to present 1 case study to 2 members of the team including our Director of Product Design for Growth and another Lead Designer.</li>
<li style="""">Final loop (1.5 hours). 2 interviews covering Impact and teamwork. These typically happen on the same day via 2 separate video calls. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our average process takes around 2-3 weeks but we will always work around your availability.

You will work hand in hand with engineers, data scientists, product managers, sales engineers, account executives, and customers to build full-stack products that stretch from hardware firmware to cloud services and mobile apps and use AI at the core of everything. </p>
<p>Key challenges you will tackle include:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Build and deploy AI models that predict failures before they happen and surface actions that save fleets real money.</li>
<li style="""">Turn billions of sensor readings into clear decisions that raise uptime and cut fuel use.</li>
<li style="""">Automate maintenance and warranty workflows.</li>
<li style="""">Lift vehicle uptime and reliability. Cut unplanned repair costs and roadside breakdowns.</li>
<li style="""">Optimize fuel and energy use mile by mile.</li>
<li style="""">Extend engine and battery life for mixed fleets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will define the vision, run experiments, and deliver world class products. If you can ID a Cummins by its exhaust note and still have a shelf of Hot Wheels trucks, you’ll feel right at home here.</p>
<p><strong>What we look for</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">8-10+ years in product management with at least 2 years leading people.</li>
<li style="""">Hands-on experience in fleet, automotive tech, or industrial IoT is desired.</li>
<li style="""">Track record of shipping products that cut cost or boost uptime. </li>
<li style="""">Be extremely comfortable with data analysis. </li>
<li style="""">Clear, open communicator who can align many highly opinionated teams.</li>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Through <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://hts.hopper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HTS</a>, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are <a class=""postings-link"" href=""http://1.6x/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1.6x</a> more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>

Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>

<p><strong>About Mission Lane:</strong></p>
<p>Founded in December 2018, <a href=""%22https:/www.missionlane.com/about%22"" rel=""nofollow"">Mission Lane</a> is a purpose-driven fintech company based in the U.S., with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. </p>
<p>It all started with a realization:  nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn’t have access to a clear line of credit. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-perfect credit scores or no scores at all. We decided this just wouldn’t do.</p>
<p>In partnership with our sponsor banks, we offer credit cards under the Mission Lane brand name, with better, clearer terms, and a more refined customer experience than the alternatives available to people working hard to improve their credit.</p>
<p>To date, over three million consumers have chosen Mission Lane, earning high customer ratings on Credit Karma for its market segment and industry leading Net Promoter scores. </p>

<p>🚀<strong> THE OPPORTUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Tired of boring pipelines and clunky data tools? So are we.</p>
<p>We're building an AI-powered ELT platform that takes the pain out of data engineering — automating the boring stuff and helping teams move faster, cleaner, and smarter. As a Backend Developer, you’ll be writing real code that solves real problems at scale, using modern tools (Python, TypeScript, AWS) and working with people who love clean architecture and shipping fast.</p>
<p>🧠 <strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p>You’ll join a remote crew of engineers, product thinkers, and designers who:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Care about writing clean, testable code.</li>
<li style="""">Actually enjoy talking about systems, performance, and architecture.</li>
<li style="""">Believe in async-first work, deep focus time, and short meetings.</li>
<li style="""">Want to build something developers would love to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re here to ship product, not PowerPoints.</p>
<p>🛠️ <strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Build and evolve our backend using Python and TypeScript (Node.js).</li>
<li style="""">Design and scale REST APIs for high-performance data operations.</li>
<li style="""">Use AWS tools like Lambda, S3, Redshift, and DynamoDB to power our platform.</li>
<li style="""">Help shape our infrastructure using Terraform and the Serverless Framework.</li>
<li style="""">Collaborate across product, design, and QA to deliver features that just work.</li>
</ul>
<p>🧩<strong> WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">At least 3 years of experience with a backend language (e.g., Python, Java, C); our stack is <strong>Python and TypeScript.</strong></li>
<li style="""">You’ve touched AWS or other cloud platforms, and know your way around REST APIs.</li>
<li style="""">You care about performance, code clarity, and reducing complexity.</li>
<li style="""">You write code you’d be proud to show other devs.</li>
<li style="""">Strong English skills  — we're remote, so clear communication matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>📅 <strong>YOUR FIRST 90 DAYS</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Day 1–30: Set up, explore the stack, fix something small, push code to prod.</li>
<li style="""">Day 31–60: Own a feature, work closely with QA, and demo your code.</li>
<li style="""">Day 61–90: Lead a feature, deploy it, squash bugs, and drop 🔥 PRs like a pro.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY THIS ROLE ROCKS</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Modern stack, no legacy mess.</li>
<li style="""">Full ownership, no micromanagement.</li>
<li style="""">Remote-first culture built for devs.</li>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>More about Hopper</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Through <a class=""postings-link"" href=""https://hts.hopper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HTS</a>, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are <a class=""postings-link"" href=""http://1.6x/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1.6x</a> more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace. </p>

More than 80% of borrowers are approved instantly, with zero documentation to upload.</p>
<p>Upstart is a digital-first company, which means that most Upstarters live and work anywhere in the United States. However, we also have offices in San Mateo, California; Columbus, Ohio; and Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>Most Upstarters join us because they connect with our mission of enabling access to effortless credit based on true risk. If you are energized by the impact you can make at Upstart, we’d love to hear from you!</p></div><p>As the <strong>Director of Product, Capital Platform </strong> you will build and lead the product team responsible for growing capital across our loan products.

In this role, you will own the end-to-end product vision, strategy, and execution to create value for the diverse set of banks, credit unions and capital market investors on our platform.</p>
<p>The role starts as a senior individual contributor and is expected to expand into leadership of a product team.</p>
<p>Capital providers on our platform expect robust oversight and analytics; nuanced control over the loans they fund and on their portfolio overall; and automation in managing every aspect of their lending program.

You will work widely across our loan vertical teams to be the voice of capital providers as we develop those products beyond personal loans (Auto loans, HELOCs, etc).</p>
<p>Success in this role relies on working with a wide variety of stakeholders, developing a detailed understanding of the consumer lending landscape and effectively balancing platform vs. team specific roadmaps.

Click Therapeutics also complies with all applicable national, state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment as well as employment eligibility verification requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act. All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U. S. For certain classes of temporary visas, the resulting work authorization may be specific to Click Therapeutics and the specific job and/or work site. Click Therapeutics may at its business discretion decide to or refrain from obtaining, maintaining and/or extending the temporary visa status and/or sponsoring a colleague for permanent residency and /or employment eligibility, considering factors such as availability of qualified U.S. workers and the colleague's long-term prospects for securing lawful permanent residence, among other reasons. Employment applicants requiring immigration sponsorship must disclose, when initial application for employment is made, whether or not they are legally authorized to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. and, if so, whether that authorization permits them to work in the job they seek. In no case should Click Therapeutics support of a colleague's temporary visa application or sponsorship of a colleague for permanent residence be construed to guarantee success of that application or amend or otherwise invalidate the ""at-will"" employment relationship between the colleague and Click Therapeutics.</p>

Senior ITDR Threat Intelligence Analyst,No especificado,USA,2025-04-04 02:51:03,full_time,,"<p><strong>Reports to: Director, Adversary Tactics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Remote US</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compensation Range: $160,000.00 to $170,000.00 base plus bonus and equity </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Do:</strong></p>
<p>Huntress is a fully remote, global team of passionate experts and ethical badasses on a mission to break down the barriers to cybersecurity. Whether creating purpose-built security solutions, hunting down hackers, or impacting our community, our people go above and beyond to change the security game and make a real difference.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by former NSA cyber operators, Huntress protects all businesses—not just the 1%—with enterprise-grade, fully owned, and managed cybersecurity products at the price of an affordable SaaS application. The Huntress difference is our One Team advantage: our technology is designed with our industry-defining Security Operations Center (SOC) in mind and is never separated from our service.</p>
<p>We protect 3M+ endpoints and 1M+ identities worldwide, elevating underresourced IT teams with protection that works as hard as they do. As long as hackers keep hacking, Huntress keeps hunting.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do: </strong></p>
<p>The Huntress ThreatOps team has the unique honor of waking up every morning knowing we will make hackers regret targeting our partners and customers. We’re looking for someone who wants to pour all of their creativity into researching, hunting, and discovering threats in our customer networks. Competitive candidates have experience leading a team composed of various researchers involved in the threat intelligence cycle. Candidates should also have experience creating Threat Intelligence reports, advocating for product enhancements, and public speaking. </p>
<p>Threat Intelligence Analysts aggregate threat data from the previous month and build reports for our customers.  These reports may also be used for marketing and to illustrate the value of what Huntress provides to customers and the community. Threat Intelligence Analysts are also responsible for writing blog posts and marketing materials regarding emerging threat trends. They also work closely with Security Researchers to obtain more context about threat data.  </p>
<p>Familiarity with product management, scripting/development, incident response, malware analysis, configuration management, and antivirus technologies are additional ways to differentiate yourself.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, success doesn’t happen in a vacuum. An effective hunter fosters highly collaborative environments between the Product, Marketing and Threat Operation Center teams to accelerate our mission and secure the 99% of businesses who fall below the enterprise poverty line. This collaboration is needed to produce and prioritize a unified technical vision which ultimately delivers our most impactful features and capabilities.</p>
<p>We defend over 2.5M endpoints across 33,000+ mid-sized and small business customers, and that number continues to grow each month. Considering this market’s tighter budget, it’s not financially possible to dedicate human analysts to each client. The Security Operations team addresses this challenge head-on by building and scaling highly automated efficiencies—often lightly augmented by our SOC — that make intruders earn every inch of their access while maintaining affordability and healthy gross margins.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a <strong>Senior Data Analyst</strong> to help us shape how we collect, analyze, and act on data across our AI-powered coding platform. You’ll build scalable data infrastructure, design high-quality data models, help evaluate our agents, and make sure decision-makers have the insights they need — from engineers to product managers to the founder.</p>
<p>You’ll be joining a small but ambitious Data &amp; Analytics team on the ground floor. This is a rare opportunity to set the foundation for analytics at a fast-moving AI company led by serial founder Andrew Filev (ex-Wrike), where your work directly impacts the future of how software is built.</p>
<div class=""h2"">🔍 What You’ll Do</div>
<ul style="""">

<li style="""">Develop and implement standardized processes for tracking new analytical events;</li>
<li style="""">Turn raw data into real insights — dig into product usage, agent performance, and user behavior to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and where to go next.</li>

</ul>
<div class=""h2"">🧰 Tech Details</div>
<p>Our current toolkit includes <strong>Amplitude, GCS, BigQuery, DBT, and Python</strong>, but we’re not locked in. You’ll help shape the architecture and pick the right tools as we scale.</p>
<p>We work with <strong>massive, AI-specific data</strong> like prompts and user content — not just pageviews and clicks. There’s very little legacy, so you won’t spend your days untangling old pipelines. Instead, you’ll be laying the groundwork for a data platform that powers the future of AI development.</p>
<div class=""h2"">🧠 What <strong>You Bring</strong></div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Strong statistical or mathematical background.</li>
