<p>It all started with a realization:  nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn’t have access to a clear line of credit. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-perfect credit scores or no scores at all. We decided this just wouldn’t do.</p>
<p>In partnership with our sponsor banks, we offer credit cards under the Mission Lane brand name, with better, clearer terms, and a more refined customer experience than the alternatives available to people working hard to improve their credit.</p>
<p>To date, over three million consumers have chosen Mission Lane, earning high customer ratings on Credit Karma for its market segment and industry leading Net Promoter scores. </p>
<p>Mission Lane has cumulatively raised over $600 million of equity from leading investors, including Invus Opportunities, QED Investors, LL Funds, funds affiliated with Oaktree Capital Management, and other leading investors.</p>

<p>Imagine working at a company where you experience the best of both worlds: the fast-paced execution of a startup paired with the guidance of leaders who have built successful scalable solutions. Led by veteran innovator Hannes van Rensburg, we are not just rethinking the evolution of physical retail—we are <em>redefining </em>it.</p>
<p>At The Internet of Behaviors Company (IOB), we envision a future where physical shopping becomes an enjoyable social and retail experience once again.

We’re looking for great teammates to help us shape the future of connected retail, and we invite you to join us.</p>
<p>We believe that physical retail is NOT dead; rather, it has yet to evolve alongside today’s modern customers.

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We are looking for a part-time (20-30 hours/week) data scientist or data analyst to contract with us on building internal reporting dashboards in Tableau for <a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a>, where our mission is to <em>make people matter more than money in our democracy</em>.  </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">This role is primarily focused on dashboard development and minor data transformation, supporting various teams across the organization. You will work with an existing data science contractor and collaborate with team leads as key stakeholders. This is a contract position for 4-6 weeks depending on start date, with the potential to extend.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>About</strong><u> </u><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><u>GoodParty.org</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> is empowering Independents to run, win, and serve so we can transform civic leadership. In 2024, we helped elect 3,444 Independent candidates into local offices across 48 states. Why?</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Americans – especially young people – have been losing faith in democracy. The rigged, two-party system has turned “Independent” into a dirty word. Voters are trapped between choosing the lesser of two evils or sitting out elections altogether.<br><br>A majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans nor Democrats represent them. But they keep getting re-elected! Whether you’re concerned about healthcare costs, wars, the environment, our individual freedoms, or inequality, many great solutions are held back by the dark doom loop of dysfunctional partisan politics. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">While mainstream media and the two major parties focus on federal elections (Congress and the President),<u> </u><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> is building from the bottom up. With over 500,000 elected offices in the United States—70% of which are uncontested—GoodParty.org is powering the movement to reclaim our communities from career politicians. We’re helping independents in local and state-level campaigns nationwide. Together, we’re building a truly representative democracy where society’s biggest problems are solved.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> empowers independents to run, win, and serve in public office without the influence of partisan or big-money support. Through our free, AI-powered tools, we enable independent candidates to prioritize people over parties and community over corporate funding, transforming real people into civic heroes. We’re a platform, not a political party. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">And, it’s working! Starting with 11 wins in the 2023 election cycle,<u> </u><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> set an audacious goal for 1,000 wins in 2024. We beat expectations – 3,444 candidates won this past November and are serving in office across 48 states! 40.3 million voters (26% of all 2024 voters) cast a ballot for our 6,317 candidates. Our general election win rate was 54.5%.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Looking ahead, we’re building on our momentum and expanding our product offerings to help candidates deliver on their promises and serve their constituents effectively. Candidates who partner with us come from across the ideological spectrum and pledge to uphold people-powered principles, anti-corruption practices, and a commitment to civility. Together, we aim to transform civic leadership, bringing real accountability to public service and setting a new standard of leaders who prioritize the people they serve.  <a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> is founded by serial entrepreneur,<a href=""https://farhadmohit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u> Farhad Mohit</u></a>, with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate.</p>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Our mission</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Climate change is causing deep uncertainty at all levels of society, with climate volatility reducing the security of all land-based assets and posing a multi-level security threat for the functioning of enterprises, societies, and governments.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Mitiga is a spinoff of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which hosts MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Mitiga's mission is firmly rooted in employing cutting-edge science and technology to mitigate the multifaceted risks posed by climate-driven perils. Our approach spans a spectrum of temporal scales, from real-time and annual forecasts to projections spanning the next century. This comprehensive perspective on risk, coupled with our capacity to transfer risks to capital markets via catastrophe bonds, positions us to significantly contribute to enhanced climate mitigation, resilience, and equity.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">And we need you.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>What you will do</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>If you build it, data will come: </em>you'll help us put in place a system where data can travel easily from the capture point to the warehouse and through transformation processes to become useful information. Your superpowers will be put to use in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable data pipelines and ETL processes to ingest, transform, and store large volumes of data. In addition, you'll build and optimise data models, databases, and data catalogs to support retrieval needs.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>A sum of many parts</em>: you'll constantly be on the lookout for ways to make cleaner, more accurate data. This includes fixing any broken or outdated parts of the pipeline, as well as identifying and resolving performance and scalability issues in data processing and storage systems. But you won't be alone in troubleshooting; you'll collaborate with great data scientists, developers, and scientists at Mitiga to understand data requirements and translate them into technical solutions.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>You're picky about quality</em>: you understand that quality is paramount when it comes to using and scaling the use of data. You'll implement data governance and data quality frameworks to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of our data. Additionally, you'll stay up to date with industry best practices, emerging technologies, and trends in data engineering and analytics to continuously push the envelope at Mitiga.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>Sharing the knowledge:</em> you'll generously share your wealth of knowledge and experience by mentoring and providing technical guidance to junior members of the data engineering team. You'll also actively participate in code reviews and promote coding standards and best practices within the team.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Your expertise stems from a B.S. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related data field. You're a pro at orchestration, including containers like Docker and Kubernetes, as well as tools like Terraform, GitHub CI/CD, Git, and Jenkins. Plus, your impressive experience extends to pipeline tools like Argo, Airflow, Prefect or CVD. You have been working with APIs and offering data to clients and partners.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Python and multidimensional data processing libraries like xarray, along with parallelisation libraries such as dask and mpi, are second nature to you. And of course, you're fluent in English!</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Your love for learning drives you to embrace new and challenging areas. You're a team player who thrives on collaborating and building cool stuff with your teammates. The fast-paced, results-oriented culture of a startup excites you, and you're no stranger to agile methodologies (hello, Jira). You share our mission goals and always strive to deliver top-notch solutions of the highest quality and on time.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">If you're ready to bring your skills and attitude to our team, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Diversity</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">A recent study shows that one in every 10 tech workers in Spain are women. Only 8% of all contracts in 2019 with people with disabilities were in technology and science. Meanwhile, 30% of LGTBIQ people in Spain do not come out in the workplace for fear of discrimination.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">This is neither the world we want to live in nor the workplace we’re building.  </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Mitiga is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">In fact, we strongly encourage applicants from minority groups to apply.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Our offer</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our vision is to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to stay and do their best work. Some of our benefits, like unlimited personal time or flexible working arrangements, help work adjust to your life – and not the other way around. You can work from home or come twice a week to our office in the heart of Barcelona. Dogs and other furry friends are welcome!</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our compressed work schedule allows you to work half a day on Fridays during the year (so you can start the weekend early). During the summer, it also allows you to work 4 days a week, so you spend time with your loved ones (or work on your tan). Shadow our leadership and participate in our structured feedback and mentorship programs. If you grow, we grow.</p>

<div class=""h2""><strong>How we're different</strong></div>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.scoutnow.ai/"" rel=""nofollow"">Scout AI</a><a href=""https://www.teamups.ai/"" rel=""nofollow""> </a>is a new hiring platform that connects software engineers to opportunities with world-class companies. On Scout, you get a more relevant and growthful interviewing experience, you receive feedback on your performance, and you also get end-to-end support to improve your chances of getting hired.</p>
<p>If you perform well on the Scout interview, you become eligible for opportunities with all companies in the Scout network (only complete the interview once).</p>
<p><strong>This role is with our partner company that is actively hiring:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sparkwise</strong></p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>About the company</strong></div>
<p>Hi, I'm Ari, co-founder and CTO at <a href=""https://sparkwise.co"" rel=""nofollow"">Sparkwise</a>. I've spent 20+ years building learning environments for different learning contexts, and am now focused on supporting transformational learning in the workplace. At Sparkwise, we started with a virtual learning experience that centers collaboration and human connection, and engineered platform and program management tools that can scale to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. We're happy to share that we're looking to bring on a new core member to our engineering team. In this full-stack engineering role, you'll help design, build, and shape the future of product engineering at Sparkwise.</p>
<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>
<p>The world is getting faster, faster. To succeed, organizations are pouring in trillions of dollars to adopt new technologies, upskill their people, and transform their teams.</p>
<p>But it's hard to build new skills, mindsets, and behaviors at scale. Digital content doesn't engage, high-touch live learning can't scale, and AI-only tools lack human connection.</p>
<p>At Sparkwise, our mission is to scale the best way humans learn and transform by automating McKinsey-caliber collaborative capability building, enabled by AI. Our tech facilitates real-time problem solving, collaboration, and practice in small groups — without the need for live facilitators. Companies use our platform to teach skills, instill excellence, harness collective intelligence, drive change, and more.</p>
<p>Our clients include world-class organizations such as Harvard Business Publishing, Google, top consulting firms, and more. We're funded by top VCs and angels.</p>

<p><strong>POSITION SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>As the Senior DevOps Engineer focused on Observability, you will set observability standards, lead automation efforts and mentor engineers ensuring all monitoring and Datadog configuration changes are implemented Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). You will lead the design and management of a code-driven Datadog observability platform, providing end-to-end visibility into Java applications, Kubernetes workloads and containerized infrastructure. This role emphasizes cost-effective observability at scale requiring deep expertise in Datadog monitoring, logging, tracing and optimization techniques. You'll collaborate closely with SRE, DevOps and Software Engineering teams to standardize monitoring and logging practices to deliver scalable, reliable and cost-efficient observability solutions.</p>
<p>This is a hands-on engineering role focused on observability-as-code. All monitoring, logging, alerting, and Datadog configurations are defined and managed through Terraform, APIs and CI/CD workflows — not manual configuration in the Datadog UI.</p>

</li>
<li style="""">
<p>Serve as the primary point of contact for Datadog-related requests, supporting internal teams with onboarding, integration and usage questions</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p>Continuously audit and tune monitors for alert quality, reducing false positives and improving actionable signal detection</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p>Maintain clear internal documentation on Datadog usage, standards, integrations and IaC workflows</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p>Evaluate and propose improvements to the observability stack, including new Datadog features, OpenTelemetry adoption and future architecture changes</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p>Mentor engineers and develop internal training programs on Datadog, observability-as-code and modern log pipeline architecture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS:</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">
<p>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics or a related technical field</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p>5+ years of experience in DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, or related roles with a strong focus on observability and infrastructure as code</p>

We need your help to make that happen.</span></p></div><p>Base’s mission is to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and economic freedom. </p>
<p>Spindl’s mission is to help pay for that new onchain economy by offering developers both incentives to monetize their existing users, and a reliable means to acquire new ones. Ads paid for the first version of the offchain Internet; Spindl (now part of the Base team) is how we help pay for the new onchain one. </p>
<p>Base Ads/Spindl is building the first natively onchain advertising product that offers full-funnel attribution and analytics, and a transparent and permissionless two-sided ads marketplace. We believe an open ads system can help developers grow, get creators and consumers apps paid, and ultimately replace the closed, extractive ad systems of the past.</p>
<p>Our goal is not merely to offer comparable sophistication to the legacy internet marketing world of Facebook and Google, but to surpass it with the unique affordances of the blockchain: transparency, seamless payment rails, better privacy, and a shared consensus reality.</p>
<p>We are looking for a Staff Machine Learning &amp; Infrastructure Engineer to join the Base Ads team to enable and accelerate the success of Spindl and its soon-to-be launched protocol Flywheel. You’ll be the first MLE on the team, and responsible for building out our ranking system from the ground up. You’ll be in charge of picking the tools, harnessing a diverse set of internal and external data sources, working with Data Science on feature generation, and integrating models directly in our ad serving infrastructure. If Base is a fast-moving startup within Coinbase, imagine Spindl as an even earlier-stage team inside that startup. You will have impact and ownership from day one.</p>
<p>What you'll be doing:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Investigate and harness cutting-edge machine learning methodologies, including deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and graph neural networks, to address diverse challenges throughout Base. These challenges encompass areas such as feed ranking, recommendation systems, targeting, fraud detection, chatbots, and blockchain mining.</li>
<li style="""">Develop and deploy robust, low-maintenance applied machine learning solutions in a production environment.</li>
<li style="""">Create onboarding codelabs, tools, and infrastructure to democratize access to machine learning resources across Base, fostering a culture of widespread ML utilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we look for in you:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">7+yrs of industry experience as a machine learning and software engineer</li>
<li style="""">Experience building &amp; deploying backend systems at scale with a focus on data processing/machine learning/analytics.</li>
<li style="""">Exhibit our core cultural values: add positive energy, communicate clearly, be curious, and be a builder.</li>
<li style="""">Curiosity for crypto ecosystem and onchain data</li>

<p>Nice to haves:</p>

<p>Upstart is the leading AI lending marketplace partnering with banks and credit unions to expand access to affordable credit. By leveraging Upstart's AI marketplace, Upstart-powered banks and credit unions can have higher approval rates and lower loss rates across races, ages, and genders, while simultaneously delivering the exceptional digital-first lending experience their customers demand. More than 80% of borrowers are approved instantly, with zero documentation to upload.</p>
<p>Upstart is a digital-first company, which means that most Upstarters live and work anywhere in the United States. However, we also have offices in San Mateo, California; Columbus, Ohio; and Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>Most Upstarters join us because they connect with our mission of enabling access to effortless credit based on true risk. If you are energized by the impact you can make at Upstart, we’d love to hear from you!</p></div><p>As the <strong>Director of Product, Capital Platform </strong> you will build and lead the product team responsible for growing capital across our loan products. Upstart is a marketplace business – our supply-side teams bring loan-funding capital to the platform and deliver value to capital providers. In this role, you will own the end-to-end product vision, strategy, and execution to create value for the diverse set of banks, credit unions and capital market investors on our platform.</p>
<p>The role starts as a senior individual contributor and is expected to expand into leadership of a product team.</p>
<p>Capital providers on our platform expect robust oversight and analytics; nuanced control over the loans they fund and on their portfolio overall; and automation in managing every aspect of their lending program. You will own the definition, prioritization and delivery of the functionality needed to enable those customers as we scale our platform from our current $38B+ in originations to the next level.</p>
<p>Our products range from end-to-end AI-enabled origination platforms to advanced internal modeling systems to APIs that allow lenders and capital providers to integrate our technology into their existing systems and workflows. You will work widely across our loan vertical teams to be the voice of capital providers as we develop those products beyond personal loans (Auto loans, HELOCs, etc).</p>
<p>Success in this role relies on working with a wide variety of stakeholders, developing a detailed understanding of the consumer lending landscape and effectively balancing platform vs. team specific roadmaps. We view this role as a ‘player coach’ role and the right individual for the role will have expertise in - and enjoy - both working on key initiatives directly and building out a team of world-class PMs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How you’ll make an impact:</strong></p>

Senior Manager of Credit,No especificado,USA,2025-04-03T04:50:26,full_time,,"<div class='""content-intro""'><div class=""h3""><strong>ABOUT OUR COMPANY:</strong></div>
<div>The crushing weight of debt is something that we believe holds people back from reaching their dreams and making a splash in the world. So in 2013, after seeing our friends and family struggle with student loans, we created Splash Financial. 
<p>Over the years, our mission has expanded to include helping people with other forms of debt - such as refinancing credit cards, which are at all time highs in the US. And we’ve been able to refinance $6+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And we’ve raised over $70 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, and more.</p>
<p>But at our core, we’re still that little company from Cleveland with a big dream: to make people more powerful than their debt and we’re just getting started..</p>

And although we’ve been around since 2013, we still love to think like a start-up — a place that empowers good people to do great things, fast. <br>
<p>We’re friendly, folksy, and have Slack channels for both #kids-and-pets and #food. We’re good people who want to make a difference in the financial landscape, and we approach tackling challenges with creativity, passion and urgency.</p>
</div></div><p><strong>ABOUT THE ROLE:<br><br></strong>Splash Financial is seeking a Senior Manager of Credit.  The incumbent will be the key driving force behind Splash’s credit performance and responsible for explosive growth in the next few years.  The role will report directly to the VP of Credit and work very closely with other senior leaders in Credit and Operations.  The role will also have frequent exposure to the executive team with plenty room to grow into fully owning credit strategies and managing a team.</p>
